    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><i>About That</i> is a fictional website owned by <i>Simon Kelleher</i> from the book "One of Us is Lying" by Karen McManus<br>
    This website is just a fan project aimed at creating my own version of <i>About That</i> with all posts that are found in the book and some extra ones that I have created myself.<br>
    I hope you enjoy the website!
